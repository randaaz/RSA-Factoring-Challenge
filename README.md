# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Background Context

Before you continue reading, start this [song](INSERT_SONG_LINK) in the background. ðŸŽ¶

We've sniffed an unsecured network and discovered numbers used to encrypt vital documents. It seems that these numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as quickly as possible before the target fixes this bug on their serverâ€”allowing us to decode the encrypted documents.

This project is **NOT mandatory**. It is 100% optional. Engaging in any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score wonâ€™t be negatively affected if you choose not to participate, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might decrease. Have fun!

## Requirements

### General
- You can choose the language of your choice.
- OS needs to be Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Tasks

### 0. Factorize all the things! (Advanced)
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
### 1. RSA Laboratories states that for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as Task 0, except:

- p and q are always prime numbers
- There is only one number in the files
- How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
